# MatchWatch

Works with the Riot Games API https://developer.riotgames.com/apis

- Given a valid summoner_name and region MatchWatch will fetch all summoners this summoner has played with in the last 5 matches.
- These fetched summoners will now be monitored for new matches every minute for the next hour.
- When a summoner plays a new match, the summoner and match id is logged to the console.

## Implementation Details

- User interacts directly with match_watch.ex, which chains together functions in extract_summoners.ex and starts our match_monitor.ex with def start_monitor/2. There is explicit error :ok/:error tuple handling for verifying a valid summoner name and region. Once we have a valid summoner name and region, it can be reasonably expected the rest of the data transformations passed down in the function pipeline are valid.
- extract_summoners.ex interacts directly with riot_api_calls.ex and is our parsing logic for extracting the API data into useful values. Here we can take our broad API data and do whatever specific transformations we'd like for present and future use cases.
- riot_api_calls.ex is our API client that directly interacts with the urls, using our http_client() and decoding JSON with Jason. We also interact with our ETS cache (match_cache.ex and match_cache_reader.ex) here, reading and writing to eliminate uneccessary API calls. If a request is made, we check the cache first and return that entry if it exists. If not, then we call the API. These API calls are as general and broad as possible, to give us flexibility and modularity for the future.
- match_monitor.ex is a GenServer that we start in match_watch.ex with the returned values from inspect_matches/2 as the args to start_link/1. match_monitor.ex does the logic of comparing our existing matches in our cache to a newly refreshed matches list for the given names. If a new match is found, the monitor logs it.
- match_cache.ex is our ETS GenServer that starts in our application's supervisor tree. It has two tables, :matches and :names. It services both our API and Monitor. It is write only, serialized and atomic.
- match_cache_reader.ex is used for reading from the cache, allowing us to do on the fly data comparisons and eliminating unnecessary API calls. It is an independent process from the MatchCache GenServer to prevent any bottlenecks.
- Tests are using Mox, there are behaviour and switch files for this dependency.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo.

2. In preferred terminal:
